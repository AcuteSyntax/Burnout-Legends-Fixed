# Burnout Legends Fixed

Hosts the compiled, game-ready files of the Legends Fixed project, as well as all of its uncompressed assets (sounds, textures, models etc.)

**Legends Fixed** is an extensive game modification with the intention to iron out issues with the PlayStation Portable game **Burnout Legends**, as well as improve the experience with new content and high-quality audiovisual assets.

A rough outline for this project can be found at [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvSkF7xkh0Sn_A1lT9iJTvjoBMVbbU_fLH02fKgjMLY/edit).

## Installation

## Contribution Guide
