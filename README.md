# Burnout Legends Fixed

Hosts the compiled, game-ready files of the Legends Fixed project, as well as all of its uncompressed assets (sounds, textures, models etc.)

**Legends Fixed** is an extensive game modification with the intention to iron out bugs and other issues with the PlayStation Portable game **Burnout Legends**, as well as improve the experience with new content and high-quality audiovisual assets.

A rough outline for this project can be found at [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvSkF7xkh0Sn_A1lT9iJTvjoBMVbbU_fLH02fKgjMLY/edit).


## Prerequisites
* Ensure you have the **Greatest Hits** version of Burnout Legends, as this mod was built for that version
* You can do this by dumping your copy of Legends to an ISO file and checking the ISO's SHA-1 sum
* The checksum will be `ee3830a0d4e619b304a8ff960a6f0583543c9a45` for the Greatest Hits version
* If your ISO's checksum matches this, you're good to go! Proceed to the **Installation** section.

## Installation
* 1. Download the mod from this page's "Releases" section
* 2. Extract the 7z to a folder of your choice
* 3. Extract your copy of Legends to the same folder in .ISO format
* 4. Run `install_xdelta.bat`

## Contribution Guide
* Upload all **uncompressed assets** (PNG images, MP3 or WAV sounds, etc.) you'd like to contribute to the appropriate subfolder of the `SourceAssets` folder (for example, images for HUD and UI textures should be uploaded to `SourceAssets/FrontendTextures`).
